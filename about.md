<p class="message">
  Just a guy trying to do this whole data science biz. I like math, data, and cold-blooded reptiles I guess. I was never good at elevator pitches~
</p>

I went into academia wanting to be an architect and popped out a mathematician. I finished my undergraduate in Mathematics and Economics at University of California, San Diego, and went on to finish my master's degree in Mathematics (big surprise!) focusing on Actuarial Science at Roosevelt University. While on my career path to becoming an actuary, I became interested in data science, and it turned out to be a re-route instead of a pit stop.

If you want to connect with me on a deeper emotional or primal level, I like food and playing billards.
